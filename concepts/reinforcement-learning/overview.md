### Reinforcement learning

The basic principle is to maximize a reward by learning to map
*states* to *actions*.

Actions can affect only the immediate reward but also the long-term
reward.

There are four main components a *policy*, a *reward signal*, a *value function*,
and, optionally, a *model* of the environment.
